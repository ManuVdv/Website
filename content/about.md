---------------------------

Hi, I am Manu Vanderveeren. I am from Leuven, Belgium and started studying economics at the KU Leuven in 2017. I am ambitious, global minded and passionate about finance.I went on exchange to the City University of Honk Kong during the autumn of 2019 and I recently started studying at the London Business School.

**My Hong Kong Story**

My international exchange in Hong Kong during the autumn of 2019 made me grow as a person in many aspects. 
As it was the first time I was living outside of Belgium, I quickly became more independent. Studying and living in a culturally different and truly international environment certainly changed my outlook on the world for the better. Through quickly established friendships, I was able to explore, learn and discover a country, far beyond the usual tourist attractions.
But as you may be able to tell from the date I lived in Hong Kong, I was exposed to a city going through severe political change. Living on a campus, where students went on strike and revolted, I came to face times of change and uncertainty. Seeing people risking their lives for their beliefs, made me see the world in a different light, put things in perspective and grow as a person. From personal point, the protests and uncertainty made me ponder about how nations operate and leadership. The latter especially made me realize that in sound leadership one cannot afford to always take a top-down approach and that it is necessary to listen to everyone.
